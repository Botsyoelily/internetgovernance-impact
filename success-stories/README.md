### **Building Kenya's First Youth IGF** |November 2024
**By:** Amina Said & Team | Kenya  
**Category:** Community Building

After attending the global IGF, a group of young Kenyans recognized the need for local youth voices in internet governance discussions. They launched Kenya Youth IGF in 2024, bringing together 150+ young people from across the country for a two-day forum on digital rights and policy. The event produced concrete policy recommendations that were submitted to the national IGF and resulted in two youth representatives being appointed to Kenya's IGF multistakeholder group.

**Key Takeaway:** Start small, document everything, and don't wait for perfect conditions - the community will show up if you build the space.
